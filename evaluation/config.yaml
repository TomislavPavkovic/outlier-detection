# Define the root directories of the prediction and ground truth NIFTIs.
# The ground truth directory should be structured according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS).
# The prediction directory should be structured according to in BIDS or the IF-Net-Output structure.
# Both directories must only include the segmentation masks and nothing else.
